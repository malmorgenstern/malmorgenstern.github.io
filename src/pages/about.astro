		Mal Morgenstern is a writer, indie comics artist, performance artist and scholar from Durham, UK. Mal makes art that is abrasive, but brimming with a love for pop culture. They enjoy getting into the folds of bad feelings and twisting themselves like a knife. Their master’s dissertation was on masochism in the midcentury suspense novel, and it’s there in the intermingling of sensuality and violence that their work resides.
	</p>

	<p>
		They're a member of <a href="https://writingsquad.com">the Writing Squad</a>, and they have dabbled in academic criticism, media journalism, drag, and spoken word.
	</p>

	<p>
		They are currently working on:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>their debut novel, an erotic psychological thriller.</li>
		<li>their first graphic novel, about a Y2K-styled team of girlboss war criminals.</li>
		<li>an industrial cover album.</li>
		<li>a foray into youtube.</li>
		<li>...and now this blog.</li>
	</ul>	
		
	<p>Currently Mal is based in Newcastle upon Tyne but, given the Apocalypse, they're particularly interested in supporting online and remotely accessible projects. <a id="email" href="mailto:malmorgenstern@outlook.com">Contact them by email</a> if you’d like to work with them or see a portfolio of previously published work.</p>
